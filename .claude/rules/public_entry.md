# Writing Rules for Public-Facing Content

All text written to publicly visible locations must be in English.
The only exception is `README-**.md` files, which should be written in the language indicated by their suffix.

Examples of public-facing content:
- Code comments and log messages
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, and other documentation files
- Git commit messages
- GitHub PR descriptions and comments
